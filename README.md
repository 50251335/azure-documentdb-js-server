#Microsoft Azure DocumentDB SDK: Javascript Server

DocumentDB is a purpose built NoSQL JSON document database designed for modern mobile and web applications. DocumentDB supports rich queries over JSON data as well as, transactional execution of JavaScript based application logic. DocumentDB is built with a deep commitment to the JSON data model enabling it to offer differentiated query and data processing capabilities that scale to meet the needs of the most demanding modern applications.

DocumentDB supports server-side programming of Stored Procedures, Triggers and User Defined Functions (UDFs).
This server-side programming is done in JavaScript using a SDK built specifically for running on the DocumentDB servers.
For more information on these consult the [Azure DocumentDB Service Page](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/documentdb/)

This repo contains samples for building these server-side scripts using that server SDK and other useful utilities for working with these.
