#Microsoft Azure DocumentDB SDK: Javascript Server

Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service designed from the ground up to natively support JSON and JavaScript directly inside the database engine. DocumentDB supports server-side programming of Stored Procedures, Triggers and User Defined Functions (UDFs). This server-side programming is done in JavaScript using a SDK built specifically for running on the DocumentDB servers.

This repo contains samples for building these server-side scripts using that server SDK and other useful utilities for working with these.
